#Professional blog using PHP

##Author:  Rebindaine Morgane

This is my first project using PHP in OOP with OpenClassrooms, a complete professional blog with 2 sides: 
*  a public area where visitors can read articles and comment them
*  a back office where contributors can access after registration to write articles or moderate comments

To start with this project after pulling from git, configure database in the file src/Database/DatabaseMySQL.php
(host, username and password).
